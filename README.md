Project: Landing Page | The Odin Project

This project displays use of css flexbox, along with the ability to format a page however you'd like. The subscription on the site itself is not real, and was used merely to fill up space. 
## Credits

Credit for the images go to Jeffrey F Lin, Arthur Tumasjan, Giorgio Trovato, "Tandem X Visuals," and Alexas Fotos.

Credit is given in the order the images are displayed from top to bottom, left to right.

This project was created as a part of The Odin Project's foundation curriculum.
