Project: Landing Page | The Odin Project

This project displays use of css flexbox, along with the ability to format a page how you'd like, or based on an example. Information on the page is created to automatically wrap when necessary, which allows the page to be displayed appropriately on many different screen sizes.

This project was created as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s foundations curriculum.
